To manage Docker images and containers from the command line (CMD), you can use various Docker commands to delete them. Hereâ€™s how you can remove Docker images and containers:

1. Deleting Docker Containers
List Containers: First, you might want to list the containers to identify which ones you want to delete.

List Running Containers:

bash
Copy code
docker ps
This shows only running containers.

List All Containers (including stopped ones):

bash
Copy code
docker ps -a
Stop a Container: Before deleting a running container, you need to stop it.

Stop a Specific Container:
bash
Copy code
docker stop <container_id_or_name>
Replace <container_id_or_name> with the actual container ID or name.
Remove a Container:

Remove a Specific Container:

bash
Copy code
docker rm <container_id_or_name>
Remove All Stopped Containers:

bash
Copy code
docker container prune
This will prompt you to confirm the removal of all stopped containers.

2. Deleting Docker Images
List Images:

List All Images:
bash
Copy code
docker images
Remove an Image:

Remove a Specific Image:

bash
Copy code
docker rmi <image_id_or_name>
Remove Multiple Images:

bash
Copy code
docker rmi <image_id_1> <image_id_2> ...
Remove All Unused Images:

bash
Copy code
docker image prune
This removes all dangling images (images not associated with any container).

Remove All Images (Caution):

bash
Copy code
docker rmi $(docker images -q)
This command removes all images. Be cautious as this will delete all images, including those that might be in use.

3. Additional Cleanup Commands
Remove All Stopped Containers and Unused Networks:

bash
Copy code
docker system prune
This command removes stopped containers, unused networks, and dangling images. It will prompt you to confirm the action.

Remove All Unused Data (Including Volumes):

bash
Copy code
docker system prune --volumes
This command will remove all unused data, including volumes.

Summary
Stop and remove containers using docker stop and docker rm commands.
Delete images using docker rmi and docker image prune.
Perform system-wide cleanup with docker system prune.
Always double-check the containers and images you are deleting to avoid removing something important. Use docker ps -a and docker images to review before running removal commands.
